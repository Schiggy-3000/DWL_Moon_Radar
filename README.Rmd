# Moon Radar <img src="./figures/logo_1.jpg" align="right" width="120" />


## Overview

Moon Radar measures the popularity of [altcoins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Altcoins) on social media platforms Twitter, Reddit and Google Trends. If it detects a spike in popularity for a given altcoin, it notifies it's user by means of a push notification. The user can then decide to act on this information by buying or selling shares of the respective cryptocurrency. Furthermore, Moon Radar retrieves current exchange rates for altcoins from CoinGecko and reports them alongside the corresponding popularity index.


## Prerequisites <img src="./figures/logo_2.jpg" align="right" width="120" />
Make sure you have the following resources at your disposal.

1. PostgreSQL Database
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. [Apache/Airflow Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow)


## Usage <img src="./figures/logo_3.jpg" align="right" width="120" />

Start by executing 'API_...' scripts in folder '1_Historical_data_to_RDS'. This will pull historical data from several social media APIs as well as CoinGecko's API. Next, run the remaining script 'Load_historical_data_into_datalake'. This will upload all data obtained into your PostgreSQL database.

Proceed by adding the file 'API_to_RDS' from folder '2_Continuous_data_to_RDS' as a DAG in your docker airflow container.

This procedure will regularly fetch and upload data from the same APIs as before, supplementing historical data in your PostgreSQL database with current, up-to-date, information. That is already it, you established your own datalake  which comprises of tweets, posts, queries, etc. regarding altcoins as well as their currency excange rates!
